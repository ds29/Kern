# Kern

A simple Core Data manager with easy setup and fetching. Kern enables a simple context with easy-to-use fetching methods.  It's far less feature-rich than the more awesome libraries like [MagicalRecord](https://github.com/MagicalPanda/MagicalRecord) and [ObjectiveRecord](https://github.com/mneorr/ObjectiveRecord).  It serves a very simple purpose, to store and fetch data in one context.

It borrows heavily from the work of the projects above but strips it down to a bare minimum for its intended purpose.  I don't make any claim to its originality (call it a mashup). It's opininated software, if *you* want to do it differently, *you* can.

## Usage

To run the example project; clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Project directory first.


## Requirements

It requires ARC and iOS 7.  It's only for iOS.  *It probably can/will run on older/other OS requirements, but that's all it's built against.*

## Installation

Kern is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org), to install
it simply add the following line to your Podfile:

    pod "Kern"
